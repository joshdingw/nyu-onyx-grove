      "behaviorNotes": "James shows genuine interest in understanding fundamental concepts. He takes detailed notes during lectures and participates actively in class discussions about complexity analysis.",
      "teacherFeedback": "Good start with array implementations. James grasps the basic concepts well but should focus more on time complexity analysis. Recommended additional practice problems for better understanding of space complexity.",
      "parentComments": "James has been spending extra time studying the complexity analysis concepts. He mentioned finding the visual representations of algorithms particularly helpful.",
