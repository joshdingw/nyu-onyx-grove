we're here at the Marriott Marquee\n0:13\nmy name is Dave valante at wik bond.org\n0:15\nand we're here to try to extract the\n0:17\nsignal from the noise what we do at\n0:18\nthese events is we bring the guest the\n0:21\nbest guests at the event and we share\n0:24\nwith you their knowledge uh within our\n0:26\ncommunity so you can tweet us I'm at\n0:28\nDante and if you have specific questions\n0:30\nplease do we really appreciate the the\n0:32\nfeedback the folks from hack New York\n0:35\nare here the two co-founders Evan cor is\n0:37\nto my right and to his right is Chris\n0:39\nWiggins gentlemen welcome to the cube\n0:41\nthank you thanks for having us so hack\n0:42\nNew York um you see uh you know we\n0:45\ncertainly saw incubators pop up all over\n0:46\nthe place you guys aren't an incubator\n0:48\nyou're really providing support and and\n0:50\nand helping the hacker Community you\n0:52\nknow creating a place to Federate the\n0:54\nnumerous hackers so so take us through\n0:56\nhow did it all start and how long you\n0:58\nguys been around give us the history\n0:59\nsure we're about to have our fourth\n1:01\nclass of hack and why fellows in terms\n1:03\nof where it came from Evan and I are\n1:04\nboth professors we've both been teaching\n1:06\nEngineers for a long time uh and we're\n1:09\nboth very big fans of the hacker\n1:11\ncommunity and also of New York City uh\n1:13\nand so what we saw was u a desire and a\n1:16\nneed for changing the narrative for\n1:18\nyoung software Engineers who didn't\n1:20\nreally know that New York City had this\n1:21\nvibrant technology ecosystem this\n1:23\nstartup community that wanted to hire\n1:25\nthem we created hacken why to try to\n1:27\ncreate to change that narrative and try\n1:29\nto help Young software Engineers find\n1:30\nout more about the hack and white about\n1:32\nthe software about the startup community\n1:34\nin New York city so Evan uh we heard\n1:36\ntoday uh and we've course been following\n1:39\nthis for quite some time in Silicon\n1:40\nangle wiky bond that New York is now the\n1:41\nnumber two area of the country for\n1:44\nventure-backed communities of course I'm\n1:45\nfrom Boston so yet again New York beats\n1:48\nBoston and uh but you know the reality\nWhy is New York so prominent\n1:51\nis is that New York has so much\n1:54\ntechnology embedded within Industries\n1:56\nlike retail obviously Financial Services\n1:58\npublishing Etc so so why is it that that\n2:02\nNew York and how is it that New York is\n2:04\nbecoming so prominent as a uh as a tech\n2:07\noriented in uh area well I think there\n2:09\nhave always been strong technologists in\n2:11\nNew York certainly Chris and I uh have\n2:13\nseen many many strong technologists come\n2:15\nthrough uh NYU in Columbia uh what you\n2:19\nsee now is that more of those\n2:20\ntechnologists are going out into and\n2:22\nstarting companies uh traditionally they\n2:24\nhad gone to some of the bigger companies\n2:26\nin New York and I think hacken Y is\n2:28\nplaying a role in exping these options\n2:31\nto the community and yet the New York\n2:33\nCity Tech Community since we've been\n2:35\ndoing this for the last four years uh\n2:38\nhas really come into its own you know\n2:40\njust this week we saw um Fab raised uh a\n2:44\nvery big round and make aot was sold uh\n2:48\nfor $43 million I think one of the\n2:50\nthings you see in New York is we have\n2:51\nmany strong ecosystems in New York City\n2:53\nmany strong verticals all of those\n2:55\nverticals are being transformed by\n2:56\ntechnology so something special about\n2:58\nthe startup community in New York City\n3:00\nis it's not that we have a startup\n3:01\nCommunity that's in isolation it's that\n3:03\nall of our strong verticals media\n3:04\nadvertising publishing whatever are\n3:06\nbeing changed by technology and really\n3:08\ncreating a a a diverse ecosystem so talk\nHackNY\n3:10\na little bit more about hack New York uh\n3:12\nhow do people get involved and and and\n3:15\ntalk a little bit about the ecosystem\n3:16\nthat you guys are developing sure so um\n3:20\nyou know we again we we're trying to\n3:22\nFederate the next generation of hackers\n3:23\nfor the New York City Innovation\n3:24\ncommunity so what we do is we introduce\n3:27\nnew students to the hacker community so\n3:30\nwe do that through hackathons that we\n3:32\nhave twice a year we have one in the\n3:33\nfall one in the spring uh either at NYU\n3:35\nor Colombia and this allows us to\n3:37\nintroduce new people into the ecosystem\n3:39\nwe teach them what it what it means to\n3:41\nbuild on top of an API you know we give\n3:43\nthem a lot of the skills that they may\n3:45\nnot get in a traditional college\n3:46\neducation and then of course Chris\n3:48\nreferred to the fellowship program this\n3:50\nis we take the top Hackers from around\n3:52\nthe world and we give them a much deeper\n3:54\ndive we we introduce them to a lot of\n3:56\nthe people a lot of the players in the\n3:58\nNew York City Innovation community\n4:00\nand they they intern at startups during\n4:02\nthe day and uh there's a pedagogical\n4:04\nprogram for them at night as well now um\n4:07\nyou mentioned NYU and Columbia those are\n4:09\nthe two primary feeders for the the\n4:11\nfolks that par students come from all\n4:13\nover the world it's just those are our\n4:14\nday jobs so Evan's been teaching at NYU\n4:16\nfor about a decade I've been teaching at\n4:17\nColumbia for about a decade uh so those\n4:19\nare communities that we know well but\n4:21\nthe students themselves are coming from\n4:22\nall over the world and as Evan said the\n4:24\nhacken Y fellows program is sort of for\n4:26\nstudents who really have shown\n4:28\nExcellence at COD and shown that they\n4:30\nlove to build in code uh it's an intense\n4:33\n10we summer program for some of the best\n4:35\nMinds the other program hack and Y\n4:36\norganizers are the hackathons those tend\n4:38\nto draw hundreds of students from all\n4:40\nover the world who come to New York City\n4:41\nfor one weekend to meet New York City's\n4:44\nuh startup Community but also to meet\n4:46\neach other which we think is really\n4:47\nimportant for building a a sustained\n4:49\ncommunity so it's totally open anybody\n4:51\ncan participate is that any full-time\n4:53\nstudents you just got to be a of alpha\n4:54\ngeek you just got to love to code and uh\n4:57\nand really to want to get to know the\n4:58\nother students who love to build now uh\n5:00\nwe've been doing that for four years now\n5:02\nand tenen has been at every single\n5:04\nhackathon and they bring some of their\n5:06\nEngineers into the community and that's\n5:08\na way for our students to learn from\n5:11\npeople that are in the community so they\n5:13\nget to see what what their jobs might\n5:15\nlook like if when when they join the New\n5:18\nYork City ecosystem so tenen just\n5:19\nannounced some pretty substantial\n5:20\nsupport a $75,000 uh I guess you call it\n5:23\na sponsorship or or underwriting of of\n5:25\nhack NY uh talk about that a little bit\n5:28\nand talk a little bit more about you\n5:29\nknow ten gen's activity with you guys\n5:31\nyeah ten um we're huge fans of ten genen\n5:34\nwe love talking to people about ten\n5:35\ngenen and what a role it plays in the\n5:38\nNew York City Community uh they've been\n5:40\nstrong supporters of hacken Y since the\n5:41\nbeginning ever since our first class of\n5:43\nhacken Y fellows in 2010 they hosted one\n5:46\nof the hacken white fellow um and\n5:48\nthey've been at every one of our\n5:49\nhackathons sending evangelists to\n5:51\npresent mongodb and also to work with\n5:53\nstudents through the night as they try\n5:55\nto build on top of um New York City\n5:57\nstartups apis they've also been strong\n5:59\nsponsors and made it possible for many\n6:00\nstudents to come to our hackathons by\n6:03\nsponsoring buses all the way from the\n6:05\nEast Coast all the way from the west\n6:06\ncoast to bring students to New York City\n6:08\nuh so they've been a very big strong\n6:10\nsupporters and we and we think of them\n6:12\nas one of the startups that's you know\n6:13\nshown success in growing and shown\n6:15\nsupport for the ecosystem overall you\n6:17\nknow it's really based on a tech that\n6:19\nyou can build on and lots of other New\n6:21\nYork City startups build on top of uh of\n6:23\nmongodb and tenen as do plenty of you\n6:26\nknow major Enterprise companies so uh\n6:29\nthey've very big help to hacken Y as\n6:31\nwe've grown Through The Years so when\nHackathon\n6:32\nyou guys do a hackathon you know take us\n6:34\nthrough you give paint a picture of what\n6:35\nit's like you guys provide space you\n6:37\nknow Cloud infrastructure what what's it\n6:39\nlike sure so a typical hacken y\n6:42\nhackathon uh is a 24-hour Endeavor uh\n6:45\nthe first two hours we have New York\n6:47\nCity startups demo their apis which are\n6:49\nuh the application programming\n6:50\ninterfaces that students could build\n6:52\nprograms on top of then the next 2 to 4\n6:57\nhours we have Tech ambassadors from\n6:58\naround the city again tenen has\n7:00\nparticipated in this every single\n7:02\nsemester that we've had a hackathon\n7:04\nwhere the people in the community help\n7:06\nthe students organize around ideas help\n7:08\nthem form teams help answer some of\n7:10\ntheir technical questions then the\n7:12\nstudents continue coding uh for until\n7:15\nabout 2 hours before the 24 hours are\n7:18\nover and then the students demo the the\n7:20\napplications that they've built and uh\n7:22\nwe have a team of Judges again 10 gens\n7:24\nparticipated in this uh a team of Judges\n7:27\ndecide who the winners are and then we\n7:28\ngive the prizes way the winners uh\n7:31\nhistorically have uh demoed at the New\n7:33\nYork Tech Meetup so they get you know\n7:35\nwe're bringing college kids from around\n7:36\nthe country to New York uh and\n7:38\npresenting them and they present their\n7:41\nproducts to the New York City uh uh\n7:44\ncommunity so what kind of uh Innovations\nInnovation\n7:46\nhave come out of the first four\n7:48\nhackathons can you talk about that a\n7:49\nlittle bit we try to emphasize to the\n7:50\nstudents that we're not trying to get\n7:51\nthem to build companies or to try to\n7:53\nbuild apps but just try to build\n7:55\nsomething cool we tell students that the\n7:56\nonly Criterion is awesomeness just build\n7:59\nsomething you enjoy making and that you\n8:01\nthink that your other students will\n8:02\nenjoy seeing so uh golly we've had a lot\n8:05\nof really creative hacks over the years\n8:07\nuh this last hackathon was very Hardware\n8:09\ndominant so we had people you know doing\n8:12\ncool things like one team that won used\n8:14\ntheir iPhones as a a virtual drum kit\n8:16\nset so these kids got on stage at newor\n8:18\nTech Meetup and just took two iPhones\n8:20\nand it was as though they and everyone\n8:23\nin the audience had a drum kit in front\n8:24\nof them to play uh we've seen all sorts\n8:26\nof things like um in the browser\n8:29\nlearning to help you write an essay by\n8:31\nautomatically completing the rest of\n8:33\nyour sentences uh we've had a variety of\n8:35\nthings from you know Whimsical to\n8:37\nArtistic to really hard tech uh you know\n8:40\nit's really a diverse spectrum of\n8:42\nstudent interest and even outside of the\n8:44\nmain event of the hackathon uh\n8:46\nInnovation comes from the the community\n8:48\nof people who are there so for example a\n8:51\ncouple of our former fellows along with\n8:53\nuh a gentleman uh named Mike Smith Mike\n8:56\nSwift uh created an App an applic called\n8:59\nhacker league and now their software is\n9:02\nactually used to run our hackathon and\n9:04\nmany other hackathons around the\n9:05\nhundreds of hackathons are using this\n9:07\none platform built by these three\n9:08\nstudents two of whom are hacken y\n9:10\nfellows Mike Swift who's a great friend\n9:11\nto hacken Y uh so hacker league has\n9:13\nreally it came out of hacken Y\n9:15\nhackathons but has become a platform to\n9:17\nempower the whole student community of\n9:19\nof student hackers no would you guys\n9:20\nconsider yourselves hackers right is\n9:22\nthat fair okay so we were just out at\n9:24\nailly velocity this week and velocity is\n9:26\nsort of sort of the web performance\n9:28\noptimization some serious hackers\n9:30\nobviously going on there we had guys\n9:32\nfrom Google on and Yahoo and others um\n9:35\nand there was sort of a big discussion\n9:36\naround you know what they need uh is the\n9:39\nweb getting faster and Google course\n9:41\npresents evidence that it is but you\n9:43\nknow others say it's not fast enough so\nHackers\n9:45\nI wonder if you could talk about from a\n9:46\nhacker's perspective what is it that you\n9:49\nneed from the ecosystem uh from the the\n9:52\nthe large players that are building out\n9:53\nthe internet like I say the Googles the\n9:55\nyahoos the aamis ETC Facebook with ocp\n9:58\nand and the like what do hackers today\n10:01\nyou know need what do they look for uh\n10:03\nfrom those big leaders I think a lot of\n10:06\nwell at least for the student hackers\n10:07\nwhich are the the particular hackers\n10:09\nthat we interface with mostly they're\n10:11\nreally looking for technologies that\n10:13\nmake it possible for them to build\n10:14\nrapidly and it's a community that\n10:16\nfortunately is empowered to do so to\n10:18\nbuild these tools for themselves so you\n10:20\nknow over the years at the hackathons\n10:22\nyou can see that more and more students\n10:23\nare using Twitter boot bootstrap to\n10:25\nbuild a web app very quickly lots of\n10:27\nstudents are using mongodb which which\n10:29\nitself you know is is this open source\n10:31\ntool that's built by the community so um\n10:33\nparticularly for hackathons people are\n10:35\nlooking for tools that allow them to\n10:37\nbuild up a web app very quickly uh and\n10:39\nyou know on the front end and the back\n10:41\nend uh but fortunately it's a community\n10:43\nthat knows how to build and knows how to\n10:44\nshare so you really see that uh a lot of\n10:47\nthings from the ground up are being\n10:48\nbuilt by the community to address these\n10:50\nspecific needs I should say at velocity\n10:52\none of the talks was from a hacken y\n10:54\nalumnus uh Abe stanway gave a talk about\n10:56\nsomething that he just open sourced at\n10:57\nEtsy which I think is another example of\n10:59\nhow hack and white fellows are going on\n11:01\nto build this technology Community what\n11:04\nyou know the best thing we could have\n11:05\nasked for and dreamed of in 2010 was\n11:07\nthat these students would be out there\n11:09\nin leading uh minds and Builders uh and\n11:12\nevangelists for New York City as a Tech\n11:14\nCommunity yeah that's a really it's it's\nHow coding has changed\n11:15\nactually it's an elite conference\n11:17\nalthough they're very humble about it\n11:18\nyou know they know sort of not a lot of\n11:20\nChess spping going on it's it's a it's a\n11:22\nconference for practitioner so that's\n11:24\nthat's quite a testament um talk a\n11:26\nlittle bit about how U coding has\n11:28\nchanged over the last you know decade or\n11:31\neven half decade I mean things are\n11:32\nhappening so fast on the one hand you\n11:34\nhave you know new Innovations like you\n11:37\nknow things like node.js which open the\n11:39\nworld up to so many more developers and\n11:42\ndramatically simplify things and the\n11:43\nsame at the same time you have all this\n11:44\ncomplexity with things like clouds and\n11:46\nhybrid clouds and and security I wonder\n11:48\nif you could talk a little bit about the\n11:50\nsort of state of development and how\n11:52\nthat's changing and where you see it\n11:53\ngoing I remember when I was building web\n11:56\napps uh in the '90s\n11:59\nyou know there there were so many more\n12:00\nthings you needed to do in order to\n12:03\ncreate a web app and these days you know\n12:04\nyou have tools and environments and\n12:07\nlanguages where you could very quickly\n12:10\nprototype things and uh and just get\n12:12\nsomething out the door you know within\n12:14\nhours literally yeah your ability to do\n12:16\nthings like AB testing or now just just\n12:18\namazing but as at the same time there's\nBalancing speed and agility\n12:20\nthere's added complexities which\n12:22\ncounterbalances that that that speed and\n12:25\nand and Agility uh I think the stat I\n12:27\nheard recently was the average size of a\n12:30\nweb page is 1.5 megabytes um and of\n12:33\ncourse if you're in gaming it's probably\n12:34\nyou know 30 40 times that so how how\n12:37\ndoes the development Community look at\n12:40\nthat balance between complexity and and\n12:43\nand and Speed and Agility whether it's\n12:45\nagile or devops and some of the trends\n12:48\nthat are going on there so part of the\n12:49\nconversation among hacker hackers is how\n12:51\nto scale and what are the right tools\n12:53\nfor helping you scale you know\n12:55\nprototyping has gotten incre incredibly\n12:57\neasy so you really can sit down in the\n12:58\nspan of hours make a functioning web app\n13:00\nthat does something new uh because\n13:02\nthere's so much platform technology that\n13:04\nallows you to prototype uh at the same\n13:06\ntime transitioning from a prototype web\n13:09\napp to something that's really uh a\n13:11\nservice that can Ser scale and cons\n13:13\nserve millions of customers uh is a big\n13:16\ntopic of conversations not so much for\n13:17\nhackathon but as companies grow\n13:19\nfortunately there's a lot of tools that\n13:20\nare out there I should say one thing\n13:22\nthat's changed about coding also was it\n13:24\nis now very possible for a 16 or 17y old\n13:27\nstudent to make something that is seen\n13:28\nby you know a billion people and really\n13:30\nchanges the world uh and I I just think\n13:33\nthat that's new in human history that\n13:35\nyou know somebody so young can create\n13:36\nsomething that touches the lives of so\n13:38\nmany uh and I think that really you know\n13:40\nuh changes the awareness of young people\n13:42\nabout what their potency is you know\n13:44\nthat they could create something that\n13:45\njust has so much power to to change the\n13:47\nnarrative at a young age with so few\n13:49\nresources so little Capital it's really\n13:51\njust technical talent and creativity\n13:53\nthat are the necessary ingredients and\n13:54\nit's worth noting you know since we're\n13:56\nhere at the mongod D DB conference that\n14:00\nuh you know you can use the same tools\n14:02\nto create a very simple web app and\n14:05\ntools like mongodb can scale to very\n14:07\nvery large applications that's true so\n14:09\nstudents students and employers are\n14:11\naware of this that they don't want to be\n14:12\nlocked down to a technology that doesn't\n14:13\nscale uh and mongod Tob is an example of\n14:16\nsomething that people will use to\n14:17\nprototype a web app and you can still\n14:18\nuse it even if you're you know CERN or\n14:20\nIBM or anybody else yeah with the\n14:22\nleverage of Open Source and and of\n14:24\ncourse everybody's now hopping in the\n14:25\nbandwagon um we often joke IBM's the\n14:28\nrecovery alcoholic of Open Source uh and\nAdvice to young people\n14:32\nyou've got you know many many other\n14:33\ncompanies as well so it's we I I feel\n14:35\nlike we're entering this new wave of\n14:36\nLeverage for the from for the open\n14:38\nsource Community last question uh I\n14:40\nwonder if you would both chime in on\n14:41\nthis you know talk to the young people\n14:42\nyou guys obviously deal with and\n14:44\ninteract with many many young people\n14:46\nwhat's the bit of advice that You' you'd\n14:49\ngive them people want to get into you\n14:51\nknow this field they want to get into\n14:52\nthe Technology field they're they they\n14:54\nhave a pension for hacking what do you\n14:56\ntell\n14:57\nthem uh well first of all I think I\n14:59\nthink it's really important that all\n15:00\nyoung people do learn to code uh today I\n15:03\ndo think it'll be part of the literacy\n15:04\nof the future uh and I do want to see\n15:07\nmore uh computer science programs in the\n15:10\nK12 education system but specifically\n15:14\nyou know we live in a time as Chris said\n15:16\nwhere you can build something in eight\n15:18\nhours and if you know the language of\n15:22\nthe web if you know how to build these\n15:23\napplications you you can you can just\n15:26\nput the tool you know put your apps out\n15:28\nthere let people play with them and you\n15:30\nknow it it's just an incredible feeling\n15:33\nto sit down write code for a couple of\n15:35\nhours and have something that other\n15:37\npeople can play with yeah I mean the\n15:40\nmessage to students is to build you know\n15:41\nfind something that you want to build\n15:43\nand build it and don't get stuck there's\n15:45\nplenty of resources available to you\n15:47\nonline but there's also a community I\n15:49\nmean what you find in this community is\n15:51\nthat it's a community of Builders who\n15:52\nwant to welcome more Builders so uh\n15:54\nstudents are really encouraged to\n15:56\nparticipate and everybody is really\n15:57\nhelpful and wants young people to learn\n15:58\nlearn how

      "slideOutline": "Evan Evan Korth and Chris Wiggins, two computer science professors who run hackNY, stopped by theCUBE at MongoDB Days 2013 to discuss how their organization helps young developers enter the job market.\n\nHost Dave Vellante starts the interview by highlighting that hackNY is not an incubator; it's an educational initiative that aims to federate the next generation of hackers for the New York innovation community. Wiggins confirms, and provides a brief rundown of what he and Korth have been up to in recent years.\n\nThe two academics founded hackNY in 2010 because they sought to \"change the narrative\" for young software engineers in the area who, at the time, didn't have a vibrant community to fall back on. Wiggins notes that a lot has changed since, thanks in great part to hackNY's efforts.\n\nKorth chimes in and elaborates. He says that they hold two hackathons every year, and adds that each event attracts hundreds of developers from leading universities. He also mentions that they have a fellowship program which offers \"top hackers from around the world\" an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals and learn what it's like to work in a startup environment. Korth notes that 10gen has supported their initiative from the very start. The company has been sending MongoDB evangelists to every hackathon, and recently committed $750,000 to the fellowship program.\n\nAfter going over 10gen's other contributions to hackNY, Korth tells Dave that each hackathon lasts twenty four hours. The event begins with an API showcase that is followed by a meetup with representatives from select tech firms. Four hours later, participants divide into teams and embark on an 18-hour programming marathon. Wiggins recalls how once, a team developed an app that could transform two iPhones into a virtual drum set complete with drumsticks. Another group of attendees created a hackathon platform called Hacker League.\n\nHe and Korth wrap up the interview by highlighting that developers are looking for new technologies that can boost their productivity. In Wiggins' view, the community is excited about MongoDB because it scales remarkably well from an application development standpoint.Korth & Chris Wiggins, HackNY, at MongoDB Days 2013, with Dave Vellante and Jeff Kelly \n",
