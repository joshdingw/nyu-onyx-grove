Unlike classical systems that must be in one definite state, a quantum system can exist in a combination of different states, each with its own probability amplitude.\n\nMathematically, we can represent a superposition state as:\n|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nwhere |ψ⟩ is the quantum state, and α and β are complex numbers representing probability amplitudes.\n\nReal-world application in quantum computing:\nThe most prominent application is in quantum bits (qubits). While a classical bit must be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This property is fundamental to quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers:\n\nThis allows quantum computers to perform parallel computations, as one qubit in superposition can represent and process multiple states simultaneously, exponentially increasing computational power for certain algorithms.\n\n## Question 2\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation can be derived from the general time-dependent equation by separation of variables. Starting with the time-dependent equation:\n\niℏ ∂ψ/∂t = -(ℏ²/2m)∇²ψ + V(r)ψ\n\nWe assume the wavefunction can be separated:\nψ(r,t) = ψ(r)T(t)\n\nThrough separation of variables, we obtain:\n-(ℏ²/2m)∇²ψ + V(r)ψ = Eψ\n\nThis is the time-independent Schrödinger equation, where:\n- E is the energy eigenvalue\n- V(r) is the potential energy\n- ψ is the wavefunction\n- ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant\n- m is the particle mass\n\nSignificance:\n1. Describes stationary states of quantum systems\n2. Predicts discrete energy levels in bound systems\n3. Provides basis for understanding atomic structure\n4. Enables calculation of allowed quantum states\n\n## Question 3\nClassical vs. Quantum Particle in a Box:\n\nClassical Description:\n- Continuous energy levels\n- Particle can have any energy\n- Position and momentum known simultaneously\n- Smooth, continuous motion\n- Energy: E = p²/2m (any value allowed)\n\nQuantum Description:\n- Discrete energy levels\n- Only certain energies allowed\n- Position and momentum uncertain\n- Standing wave patterns\n- Energy levels: En = (n²h²)/(8mL²), n = 1,2,3...\n\nEnergy Level Diagram:\n\nWavefunctions:\nψn(x) = √(2/L)sin(nπx/L)\n\nKey differences:\n1. Quantization of energy\n2. Zero-point energy (E₁ > 0)\n3. Probability distribution\n4. Tunneling possibilities\n\n## Question 4\nQuantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently. Instead, a quantum mechanical description of the system can only be given for the pair or group as a whole.\n\nMathematical representation of an entangled state:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩A|1⟩B - |1⟩A|0⟩B)\n\nApplications in Quantum Cryptography:\n\n1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):\n   - Uses entangled photon pairs\n   - Any eavesdropping attempt disturbs the quantum state\n   - Provides unconditionally secure communication\n\n2. Implementation Example (BB84 Protocol):\n   ```\n   Alice's Basis:  + × + + × × + ×\n   Bob's Basis:    + + × + × + × ×\n   Raw Key:        1 - 0 1 - - 1 0\n   ```\n\n3. Security Features:\n   - No-cloning theorem prevents copying\n   - Measurement affects the system\n   - Eavesdropping immediately detected\n\n4. Current Applications:\n   - Satellite-based quantum communication\n   - Metropolitan area quantum networks\n   - Banking and government security",
