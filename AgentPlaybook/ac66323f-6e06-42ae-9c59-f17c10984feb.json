PriorityField\n\n**Purpose**: To visually represent the importance/urgency of an assignment.\n\n**Field Structure**:\n- Based on StringField\n- Limited set of values: \"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"\n\n**Isolated View**:\n- Full priority label with background color\n- Text + visual indicator\n- Size: Medium prominence\n\n**Embedded View**:\n- Compact but still readable text label\n- Color-coded background\n- Size: Smaller but still includes text\n\n**Fitted View** (by container size):\n- Badge (≤150px): Just a color dot\n- Strip (>150px): Small colored pill with text\n- Tile/Card (≥400px): Colored label with text\n\n**Visual Hierarchy**:\n- High priority stands out most with bright red\n- Medium priority with amber/orange\n- Low priority with teal/blue (visually recedes)\n\n### 2. ProgressField\n\n**Purpose**: To show the current completion status of an assignment.\n\n**Field Structure**:\n- Based on StringField\n- Limited set of values: \"Not Started\", \"In Progress\", \"Completed\"\n\n**Isolated View**:\n- Full status label with appropriate background color\n- Text + potential icon (checkmark for completed)\n- Size: Medium prominence\n\n**Embedded View**:\n- Compact text label with color coding\n- Size: Smaller but includes text\n\n**Fitted View** (by container size):\n- Badge (≤150px): Color dot only\n- Strip (>150px): Small colored pill, potentially just initials (\"NS\", \"IP\", \"C\")\n- Tile/Card (≥400px): Text label with color\n\n**Visual Hierarchy**:\n- \"Completed\" stands out in green (success)\n- \"In Progress\" in blue (active)\n- \"Not Started\" in gray (inactive)\n\n### 3. AssignmentCategoryField\n\n**Purpose**: To classify assignments by subject area.\n\n**Field Structure**:\n- Based on StringField\n- Common academic categories: \"Science\", \"Mathematics\", \"Humanities\", etc.\n\n**Isolated View**:\n- Category label with subtle background color\n- Full text displayed\n- Size: Medium prominence\n\n**Embedded View**:\n- Text label with subtle visual distinction\n- Size: Compact\n\n**Fitted View** (by container size):\n- Badge (≤150px): Omitted or first letter only\n- Strip (>150px): Truncated with ellipsis if needed\n- Tile/Card (≥400px): Full category name when space permits\n\n**Visual Hierarchy**:\n- Less visually prominent than priority and progress\n- Subtle background color or font styling for distinction\n- Consistent position in layouts\n\n## Space Allocation Priorities\n\n**When space is very limited (Badge/Small Strip):**\n1. Assignment name (truncated if necessary)\n2. Priority indicator (dot)\n3. Due date (numeric only)\n4. Progress indicator (dot)\n5. Category (omitted if needed)\n\n**When space is moderate (Strip/Tile):**\n1. Assignment name\n2. Due date\n3. Priority (with text)\n4. Progress status (with text)\n5. Category\n\n**When space is ample (Card):**\n1. Assignment name (potentially larger font)\n2. All metadata fields displayed\n3. Description (truncated for fitted cards, full for isolated)\n\n## Responsive Behavior\n\nAll custom fields will follow Boxel's responsive sizing system, adapting from badges to strips to tiles to full cards based on container size. The fields themselves will have internal responsive behavior based on their containing element's size.\n\nThis approach will maintain consistency while providing appropriate information density for each viewing context."

          "memory": "# Custom Field Implementation and CSS Design Decisions\n\n## Custom Field Approach\n\nI've implemented three custom fields that enhance the HomeworkAssignment card's functionality and appearance:\n\n1. **PriorityField**: Represents assignment priority with semantic colors and responsive display\n2. **ProgressField**: Shows completion status with intuitive color-coding and space-efficient indicators\n3. **AssignmentCategoryField**: Categorizes assignments with subject-specific styling and adaptive display\n\n## Design Decisions and Implementation\n\n### Field Structure\n\nAll three custom fields are built on top of the StringField, with each containing a stringValue property that stores the actual value. This approach allows us to:\n\n- Use simple string values in the underlying data model\n- Add rich visual presentation layers\n- Apply field-specific validation and formatting\n- Implement specialized edit interfaces for each field type\n\n### Responsive Design Approach\n\nI implemented container queries to create truly responsive field components that adapt based on their containing element's size rather than just the viewport size. This approach allows fields to be composed within different card layouts while maintaining appropriate information density.\n\n#### Key Breakpoints and Adaptations\n\n- **Badge Size (≤150px)**:\n  - Priority & Progress: Show only color dots without text\n  - Category: Show truncated or first letter only\n  - Height: Optimized for 40px (small badge) or 65px (medium badge)\n\n- **Strip Size (151px-399px)**:\n  - Priority & Progress: Show compact labels with color\n  - Category: Show truncated text with ellipsis\n  - Height: Fits within 40px (single strip) or 65px (double strip)\n\n- **Tile/Card Size (≥400px)**:\n  - All fields: Show full text with appropriate styling\n  - Layout: Maintain proper spacing and alignment with other elements\n  - Height: Adapts to various card heights (170px, 275px, 445px)\n\n### CSS Techniques Used\n\n1. **Container Queries**:\n   ```css\n   @container (max-width: 150px) { ... }\n   @container (min-width: 151px) and (max-width: 400px) { ... }\n   ```\n   Used for responsive styling based on the container size, not viewport.\n\n2. **Text Truncation**:\n   ```css\n   white-space: nowrap;\n   overflow: hidden;\n   text-overflow: ellipsis;\n   max-width: 6rem;\n   ```\n   Applied to ensure text fits available space with ellipsis when needed.\n\n3. **Flexible Layout**:\n   ```css\n   display: flex;\n   align-items: center;\n   gap: 0.25rem;\n   ```\n   Used for consistent spacing and alignment between elements.\n\n4. **Visual Adaptations**:\n   - Reducing padding and font size at smaller sizes\n   - Hiding text and showing only indicators at very small sizes\n   - Using responsive sizing for indicators (dots grow slightly at badge size)\n\n### Color System\n\nI implemented a semantic color system for both fields:\n\n- **Priority**:\n  - High: Red (#dc2626) - stands out visually to draw attention\n  - Medium: Amber (#f59e0b) - moderately attention-grabbing\n  - Low: Teal (#14b8a6) - visually recedes, less urgent\n\n- **Progress**:\n  - Not Started: Gray (#6b7280) - neutral, inactive state\n  - In Progress: Blue (#3b82f6) - active, engaging color\n  - Completed: Green (#16a34a) - success, completion color\n\n- **Categories**:\n  - Created a mapping of academic subjects to appropriate colors\n  - Each subject has a background and text color pairing\n  - Colors chosen for readability and subject association\n\n### Interactive Elements\n\nThe edit templates use custom interfaces appropriate for each field type:\n\n- **PriorityField**: Button group with color-coded options\n- **ProgressField**: Status selection with semantic colors\n- **AssignmentCategoryField**: Pre-defined academic categories with option for custom input\n\n## Main Card Integration\n\nI've updated the HomeworkAssignment card to use these custom fields via composition:\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   ```typescript\n   import { PriorityField } from './priority-field';\n   import { ProgressField } from './progress-field';\n   import { AssignmentCategoryField } from './assignment-category-field';\n   ```\n\n2. **Field Definitions**:\n   ```typescript\n   @field category = contains(AssignmentCategoryField);\n   @field priority = contains(PriorityField);\n   @field progress = contains(ProgressField);\n   ```\n\n3. **Template Usage**:\n   ```html\n   <@fields.priority />\n   <@fields.progress />\n   <@fields.category />\n   ```\n\nThis approach creates a modular, composable system where fields can be used consistently across different cards with appropriate visual styling in each context.\n\n## JSON Structure\n\nThe JSON structure has been updated to reflect the nested nature of these fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"priority\": {\n        \"stringValue\": \"High\"\n      },\n      \"progress\": {\n        \"stringValue\": \"Not Started\"\n      },\n      \"category\": {\n        \"stringValue\": \"Science\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis structure supports the nested field definitions while maintaining compatibility with the existing data model."
